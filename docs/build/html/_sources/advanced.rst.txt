Multiple languages
------------------


Languages are specified  using the 3 letter codes
`from ISO_639-3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3>`_

The metadata contains a `lang` record, which contains all codes that
a blob is available in. So if `lang` contains `eng` and `ita` (in two
lines) then it is expected that there are two files `blob_eng.tex`
and `blob_ita.tex`

A special significance is given to the code `zxx` : when present,
it should be the only language: it means that all blobs are of the form `blob_zxx.???`,
and they do not contain linguistic content; it is used for graphics.

A special significance is given to the code `mul` : when this is listed,
it means that there is single blob `blob_mul.tex`, and this will
be compiled multiple times, each time a conditional `\\ColDocLangxxx` will be
set true, and all others will be set to false.
The content of  `blob_mul.tex` should produce outputs
with appropriate content depending on the conditionals.
This is still unimplemented, though.

Some UUID have an empty list of languages, as for example those containing
the bibliography (copied to a  `blob.bib`), or style files (copied to a `blob.sty`).
