Comments
==============

The `django-comments-xtd` can be integrated in ColDoc.

If you wish to use social authentication, you may set `use_comments` to True
in ${COLDOC_SITE_ROOT}/config.ini and install `django-comments-xtd`

**Note that once you set `use_comments` to True, you cannot change it back to `False`.**
If you are unsatisfied, or at any time when you wish to disable
comments (even temporarily) you can set `COMMENTS_ENABLE=False` in the local settings file.
